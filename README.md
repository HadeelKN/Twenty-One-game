# Twenty-One-game
Twenty one if your sum &lt;= 21 you win
The game randomly distributes the player's and computer's numbers
Then the sum comparison begins
Then the player is asked if he wants to draw an additional number or not
If the player's total is less than 21, he can draw a card whenever he wants
The computer also draws a card as long as his total is less than 17
Then the winner is determined. If your total is greater than 21 or less than the computer's total, you lose, And vice versa

Note
The number 1, 11 are considered if one number appears in the player's or computer's cards and the total of these cards is less than 11, then 1 is replaced with 11 and the sum is repeated.

Then the comparison is done again to determine the player
